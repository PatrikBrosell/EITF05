Rename and overwrite login.php with hackableLogin.php
Rename and overwrite manager with hackableManager.php

hackableManager.php has been changed to use md5 instead of bcrypt.
login.php has been changed to run a sql query which we can perform an SQL injection on.

How to login:

Username should be a username that exists followed by '--<space>. E.g. test3'--<space> [1]

"From a “-- ” sequence to the end of the line. In MySQL, the “-- ” (double-dash)
comment style requires the second dash to be followed by at least one whitespace
or control character (such as a space, tab, newline, and so on)."

Password doesnt matter. :-)
